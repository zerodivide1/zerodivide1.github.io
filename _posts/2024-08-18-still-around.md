Yes, I'm still around, though I'm less active here than I used to be. As I get older, I realize how the time I have
in a day needs to be divided and I have to prioritize. I have desired to come back to the world of blogging, and
have recently been researching ways to update this site. Some things that I have been planning:

* I plan on continuing to use Jekyll to publish my site. I like Markdown and it is easy-ish to create new posts. My
  only wish is that I could publish via a mobile device, but I'm looking into it more.
* I plan on replacing my comments sections with those powered by the Fediverse. As I get wiser, I feel like
  decentralized solutions for various things is prudent strategy, and will be working to get it workin for my site.
* I plan on updating the theme for the site. I like simple and clean designs, but this theme is getting a little
  old and I think its time for a fresh coat of paint.
