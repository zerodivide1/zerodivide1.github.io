So today I wanted to take a quick detour from my normal software engineering
posts and talk a little bit about a problem that I finally re-solved for my other
hobby: photography. As many hobbyist photographers know, [MagicLantern](http://www.magiclantern.fm/)
is an awesome open-source alternative firmware for many Canon cameras. I myself
own a T3i/600D and have been using MagicLantern on it for a while now. I also own
an old Eye-Fi GeoX2 card to make it easier for me to geotag and sync my pictures.
