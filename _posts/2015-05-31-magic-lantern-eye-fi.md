So today I wanted to take a quick detour from my normal software engineering
posts and talk a little bit about a problem that I finally re-solved for my other
hobby: photography. As many hobbyist photographers know, [MagicLantern](http://www.magiclantern.fm/)
is an awesome open-source alternative firmware for many Canon cameras. I myself
own a T3i/600D and have been using MagicLantern on it for a while now. I also own
an old Eye-Fi GeoX2 card to make it easier for me to geotag and sync my pictures.

A couple years ago I managed to do what many said was difficult or impossible
to do: get MagicLantern to work with the Eye-Fi cards. And the marriage between
the two worked nearly flawlessly for a long time. However, a few months ago, the
card had become corrupted and I had to low-level format the card. From this point
on, MagicLantern did not want to work with the card. It did not help that I did
not note down what I did to get the solution to work. I gave up on it for the
time being, assuming that I would get back to fixing it at some point later.

Well, a much longer time passed than I expected and I now had a new need for my
camera - and I wanted to be able to use MagicLantern's features again. So today
I sat down in front of my computer & began hammering at it to get it to work. I
finally came upon the answer and got it working.
