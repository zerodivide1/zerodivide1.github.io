Just as the title says, recently I've been considering replacing my personal
laptop with a MacBook Pro, and it makes me feel dirty. People who have known me
for a long time and or who have been reading my blog for a while know that I
have been ardently opposed to Apple products for a very long time. However,
when I started working at [PatientSafe Solutions](http://www.patientsafesolutions.com/),
I was outfitted with a MacBook Pro to perform my work, mainly because our
flagship product at the organization is a specialized iPhone and corresponding
suite of apps for the hospital. This was the first time I'd had to work with a
Mac, and took a while to get used to. However, like my days with Windows, I
eventually started to get used to the environment and began pushing the edges
of customization to suite my purposes: I started adding customizations around
how I interact with the filesystem, and began adding more and more utility
scripts to make my work system behave the way I needed it to accomplish the
work I had to complete.
