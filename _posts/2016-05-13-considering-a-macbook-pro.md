Just as the title says, recently I've been considering replacing my personal
laptop with a MacBook Pro, and it makes me feel dirty. People who have known me
for a long time and or who have been reading my blog for a while know that I
have been ardently opposed to Apple products for a very long time. However,
when I started working at [PatientSafe Solutions](http://www.patientsafesolutions.com/),
I was outfitted with a MacBook Pro to perform my work, mainly because our
flagship product at the organization is a specialized iPhone and corresponding
suite of apps for the hospital. This was the first time I'd had to work with a
Mac, and took a while to get used to. However, like my days with Windows, I
eventually started to get used to the environment and began pushing the edges
of customization to suite my purposes: I started adding customizations around
how I interact with the filesystem, and began adding more and more utility
scripts to make my work system behave the way I needed it to accomplish the
work I had to complete.

Personally, I enjoy working inside of Linux environments. They are more
reliable, cheaper to maintain and I work with them often both at home and at
work, so they are very familiar to me. However, with my hobbies I need a robust
UI environment that is consumer-friendly - one that responds quickly, has a
multitude of features, and a large application library, both commercial and
open-source. In my personal time, I develop applications for \*nix-based
platforms (Linux, Android) in JVM-based languages (Java, Kotlin). I also do
photography, using Photoshop to edit and compose my photos. And recently I have
added flying drones to my set of personal hobbies (with a DJI Phantom 3 & other
smaller drones, both for stunts and indoor flying). In all, my needs vary quite
a bit, but a common theme exists in all cases: I need a fast system with quick
access to various things, both through a UI and through the command line.

Recently, I've also recently wanted an environment that is consistent with the
environments I work with, both at work and at home, allowing me to "write-once-
run-everywhere". Over the last few years I've been working a lot with
[Docker containers](https://docker.io) and have even started to use them with
my own home server, allowing me to develop custom services locally and spin
them up on my home server for "production" use, or even use services
"off-the-shelf", and with the recent releases for Docker on Windows or Mac,
working with containers locally is now even easier than ever before.

So this brings me to the rationale for considering the switch to a Mac: the OSX
kernel is Unix-based (Mach to be specific), and contains at the heart of a
system extremely close to that of a Linux-based system; it also has a very
fast and un-intrusive UI with one feature that I have loved since I first
worked it in very early versions of Windows and in most Linux UIs:
multiple desktops. The other thing I have come to really appreciate about the
MacBook I work with is its shear speed. Though I don't really like tight
hardware integrations in general, on a laptop it only makes sense, and when the
OS is designed & tested with specific hardware on a laptop in mind, the result
can be very performant, and this is certainly the case with the laptop I work
with. And finally, I have been generally unimpressed with Microsoft recently.

They recently seem to be changing things for change-sake and not really
improving things (much the same way Apple has been going about their offerings
since Jobs passed away). In fact, its very telling that Microsoft is struggling
as their flagship OS has undergone 2 major revisions in the span of time that
I got the laptop I'm looking to replace, and I have yet to upgrade from Windows
7 on it since I've seen no benefit to doing so.

So, if I've been using Windows 7 since I got my last laptop and am still using
it, why change at all at this point? Well, I'm starting to have problems:
I'm having trouble with the power connector on the laptop (while
system is on and plugged in, the power connector applies power and disconnects,
causing the system to speed up and slow down a lot and does not allow the laptop
to stay powered while its on), and the laptop can not keep up any more. Its slow,
and despite my best efforts to increase speed, and applications I use on it
thrash badly because core services are now consuming tons of memory (it has 8GB,
but after startup I have only 4GB to use and I can't increase it further); also,
trying to view the recorded videos from my Phantom 3, none of the players I have
(VLC included) can handle the HD video that the Phantom 3 can record
(1080p@60fps).
