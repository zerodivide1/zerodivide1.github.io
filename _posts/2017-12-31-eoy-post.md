If you've looked at my blog, you've probably noticed that I haven't posted in quite a while. In fact, the last post here was just an apology note that I hadn't posted at all in 2017 and that I did intend to - but obviously didn't. To say that 2017 was a tough year would be an understatement, as from what I've seen and heard, it's been difficult for many in an assortment of ways. In retrospect and by comparison, I'd have to say that I had a successful - albeit extremely busy - year. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for other people though. Like most Americans, I think this past year was wrought with nervousness and constant anxiety for what the next day/week/month might bring. In fact, as I sit here writing this retrospective, it's hard for me to even remember what happened.
