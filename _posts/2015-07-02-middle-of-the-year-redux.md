Over six years ago I wrote a post on my old Blogger blog about what I believed
the [exact middle of the year was](http://blogger.seanpayne.name/2009/06/exact-middle-of-year-numerical-debate.html).
When I had written it, I remember feeling that the computations that I did
were faulty since there was just something odd about the numbers I was getting.

Today, I remembered about my old post, on this year's "Middle of the Year Day,"
and wanted to revisit the computations that I used. Re-reading the post, the
computations made logical sense, but, again, the result just felt wrong. Especially
when you introduce [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) into
the logic, things became much more murky. But then I realized something simple that
I had actually accounted for, but was subtle and forgotten as you continued to read
the post: the calculations that the exact middle of the year was made by grouping
4 years together, and dividing the four into equal pieces. Therefore, the calculation
of the time of July 2nd at 15:04:34 is not "the exact middle of the year", but rather
the "quarter marker of the current leap year cycle". In other words, on July 2nd at
15:04:34, we would be crossing another 25% through the current leap year cycle (in my
parlance, a "leap year cycle" is every 4 years).
