Over six years ago I wrote a post on my old Blogger blog about what I believed
the [exact middle of the year was](http://blogger.seanpayne.name/2009/06/exact-middle-of-year-numerical-debate.html).
When I had written it, I remember feeling that the computations that I did
were faulty since there was just something odd about the numbers I was getting.

Today, I remembered about my old post, on this year's "Middle of the Year Day,"
and wanted to revisit the computations that I used. Re-reading the post, the
computations made logical sense, but, again, the result just felt wrong. Especially
when you introduce [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) into
the logic, things became much more murky. But then I realized something simple that
I had actually accounted for, but was subtle and forgotten as you continued to read
the post: the calculations that the exact middle of the year was made by grouping
4 years together, and dividing the four into equal pieces. Therefore, the calculation
of the time of July 2nd at 15:04:34 is not "the exact middle of the year", but rather
the "quarter marker of the current leap year cycle". In other words, on July 2nd at
15:04:34, we would be crossing another 25% through the current leap year cycle (in my
parlance, a "leap year cycle" is every 4 years).

However, we do not usually look at the calendar and think about time in 4-year
cycles. We usually subdivide time based on our non-scientific concept of a year,
which means 365 days on a non-leap year and 366 days on a leap year. Thus, given
this, the middle of the year - to the hour - is July 2nd at noon on a 365 day
year. According to Wikipedia, we keep [July 2nd at noon as the middle of the year
on leap years too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2).

But, then there are timezones, so July 2nd at noon occurs at different times
for different timezones. If you remained in the same timezone throughout the year,
then the exact middle of the year would be July 2nd at noon for you, but if you
were in Los Angeles and talked to someone in New York, you would find that they
had their exact middle of the year 3 hours before you. To alleviate this discrepency
across timezones, we could use a common timezone, UTC (or GMT), and just change
the time for everyone depending on where you are in the world. Thus, if the exact
middle of the year is July 2nd at 12:00 UTC, for myself living in the Los Angeles
timezone, the middle of the year is July 2nd at 5AM (UTC-7 during summer time; or 4AM
if you don't take into account Daylight Savings, which is UTC-8). So, depending on
how you look at time, you could celebrate the middle of the year at either noon or
whatever time noon in UTC is in your own timezone.

So, six years ago, I sought to find the exact middle of the year, and over the
last half decade, the concept of the "middle of the year" became complicated by
leap years and seconds and timezones, and just the general perception of time.
Though I may have missed this year's crossing into the last half of the year, I feel
better in knowing that I was wrong, because being wrong gave me the opportunity to
look back at the question, and gave me the opportunity to evaluate my findings
in a broader context.
