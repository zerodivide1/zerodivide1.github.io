Over the last few years, I've amassed a pretty large repository of knowledge of technologies, tools and techniques within
my profession. A lot of people have often wondered how I came to know so much, but the truth is, it was actually really
simple: mostly I follow and keep up on certain Twitter users, follow a few subreddits on Reddit, and keep an ear out for
any mention of cool things in news articles. Obviously, it definitely helps to maintain a natural curiosity in all things
related to technology, since inspiration for techniques and solutions can come from a variety of sources, but also trying
to apply those techniques in imagined - but likely - scenarios. This point is important, as it helps you answer the
questions "What situations is this technology/solution well-suited for?" or "Is this technology appropriate for this kind
of problem?"

Anyway, I wanted to share my list of "resources" on the Internet, and I highly recommend taking a look, maybe even adding
it to your own bookmarks:

* Twitter

  * [@IrisClasson](https://twitter.com/IrisClasson)
  * [@kellabyte](https://twitter.com/kellabyte)
* Reddit
  * [/r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming)
  * [/r/programmingtools](http://www.reddit.com/r/programmingtools)

More to come, but these are just a couple off the top of my head.
