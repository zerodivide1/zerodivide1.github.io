This year has been particularly busy for me, but I wanted to make sure to write
at least something for my annual end-of-the-year post.

The year has been particularly difficult, with a [lot of losses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016#Deaths), and [the cosmos](https://twitter.com/zero_divide_1/status/684751241990287360) [apparently
tried to warn me](https://twitter.com/zero_divide_1/status/684873626156314624)
at [the beginning](https://twitter.com/zero_divide_1/status/684889133651746817).
But there were a few positive things this year:
* After trying many different things for years, I finally buckled down and got
myself a personal trainer to help me lose weight and get into better shape. [The
results have been great](https://www.instagram.com/p/BGejX9VyDbG7AAeJ0uR41HFgv_FEHIoonyqhRg0/),
though I've been quite lax since Thanksgiving and need to buckle down again.
* Pokemon GO was released this past summer and was immensely popular and quite
fun to play. It definitely gave my brother and I some more quality time together
and allowed me to [publish my second app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=seanpayne.name.gostatuswidget)
(even though it no longer sees as many installs due to the service being a lot
more stable than it was at launch and people are flocking away from the game
because of the less-than-fun changes to the game that the publisher has been
putting out lately).
* We helped [Ashley's best friend on her happiest day](https://www.instagram.com/p/BLW3DyzjI30_TKgAcvVvfWo--pl61V2Ebx7JEg0/) and
had a blast.
* We rescued a cat in very poor health and helped us renew our faith in humanity
while giving the cat a few more days of life and a warm bed and loving family
to help her on her way to the rainbow bridge.

Overall, the year has been a little bittersweet, and [this tweet accurately
defines the year](https://twitter.com/zero_divide_1/status/803076110590148608).
I just hope 2017 is better, not just for myself, but for all of us.
