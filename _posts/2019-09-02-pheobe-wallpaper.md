I took a couple pictures of Pheobe, my red Tesla Model 3 yesterday evening and
one of them came out really nice. No color adjustments or editing outside of
some small cropping.

I decided to post it to the [/r/TeslaModel3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/cyk93x/new_wallpaper_of_a_picture_of_phoebe_that_i_took/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) subreddit and have received some requests for the source wallpaper.

Here are a couple that I can share. Please do me a solid and keep the attribution
of the image. I did my best to keep the watermark as small in the bottom-left
corner as I could - at least keep it there if you end up re-sharing it. Thanks!
