Quick update: I've stood up a new, mildly snarky humor site: [isthisbugfixed.com][isthisbugfixed]

As a software engineer and now team lead for the product lane I work within, I've inherited a large codebase that has existed for well over a decade
and a half. There are tons of things in the backlog that our small team has never been able to get to, and a lot of them are unfortunately bugs.
Since I've been working with the codebase for over 11 years now, I have both seen the bugs, the reports and filed my own share of them. Now that I am
the technical lead for the team, my hope is that I can try to steer development to pay down some of the tech and bug debt and improve the code and product quality overall. But, it doesn't mean I can't have a little fun responding to others about some of the work that hasn't yet been completed. 

I recently read [this page][dppaw] about how passive-aggressive websites like [Let Me Google That For You][lmgtfy] and [No Hello][nh] are socially
counter-productive, and I can definitely appreciate the argument being made there, but the intent of [isthisbugfixed][isthisbugfixed] isn't to solely
be the response for a question about whether or not a bug is fixed, but rather as an addendum to the conversation with the inquirer and using the
page as a way to bring a little bit of simple levity to an otherwise disappointing response. And I hope that the team that I have worked together
with for many years can come to see my responses with this new page with the same level of sarcastic humor that I am known for.

My hope is that other developers might be able to use the site too to add a little bit of humor to their own responses when a bug isn't yet fixed due
to prioritization of other things and there is a bit of disappointment they feel with that fact, but I also hope the site is not abused in the same
way that some things like [Let Me Google That For You][lmgtfy] and other similar sites are used as a tool for dismissing conversations.
